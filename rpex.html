                <h2>What is Robotics Principles - Explore (RPEX)?</h2>
                <p>Each session of the program will be 9 weeks long, 2 sessions each, and be priced at $180 per student. Students coming from low-income backgrounds can apply to have their fee discounted or waived, provided proof of low income. Each 1.5-hour session will contain a 0.5-1 hour lesson, followed by a 0.5-1 hour workshop time, where students can make their own robots. While our summer camp, RoboCamp, follows a competition based format to simulate the First Lego League competition, we intend for this curriculum to be more poised towards project-based learning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                The curriculum is intended to be a complete introduction to robotics through LEGO Spike Prime, so mentors may aid students frequently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                The program does introduce students to Python, a high-level text based programming language, but due to the simplicity of the languageâ€™s syntax, and the fact that the more advanced features will not be utilized, we believe that Python will be a suitable way to learn programming, as it is not only easy to learn, but an industry-desired skill.

                <h2>Admissions</h2>
                <p>Student admission will be stratified per school. <br><br>
                    Schools have been chosen and provided seats based on the following criteria:
                    <ul>
                    <li>The existence of Robotics or STEM programs, which alumni of this program can continue to practice their skills in</li>
                    <li>Geographic location relative to Whitney</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    Schools are provided with a number of students to send to this program, so they can then choose students who would be a good fit for the environment. <br>
                    The program will gather attendance from as many schools as possible, disregarding the community and socioeconomic background that the students come from.
                    <br><br>
                    All applicants are expected to embody the traits and ideals of Whitney student candidates, as we intend for this program to give them a bit of insight to the Whitney campus life.
